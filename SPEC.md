# Game Results Tracking Platform - Workshop Requirements Specification

## Workshop Context
**Duration**: 4-hour hackathon workshop  
**Format**: Teams will compete to build the best solution based on a provided skeleton  
**Goal**: Create a working game results tracking platform with unique team-specific features

## Overview
A platform for tracking game results across different types of games (video games, table games, card games) with scoreboards and player rankings. Each team will extend the base implementation in different creative directions.

## Core Requirements

### R1: User Management
- **R1.1** Users SHALL be able to create an account using only a username
- **R1.2** Users SHALL be able to modify their username
- **R1.3** The system SHALL support future integration with proper authentication mechanisms

### R2: Game Management
- **R2.1** Users SHALL be able to create new game entries
- **R2.2** Game creation SHALL include uploading an image to identify the game
- **R2.3** Games SHALL have a name and type (e.g., video game, table game, card game)
- **R2.4** Users SHALL be able to browse and search for existing games

### R3: Result Tracking
- **R3.1** Users SHALL be able to submit game results
- **R3.2** A game result MUST include:
  - The game played
  - Players involved
  - Final scores or outcome
  - Timestamp
- **R3.3** Users SHALL be able to view their game history
- **R3.4** The system SHALL store all game results persistently

### R4: Scoreboards
- **R4.1** The system SHALL display scoreboards for each game
- **R4.2** Scoreboards SHALL show player rankings based on wins/losses
- **R4.3** Users SHALL be able to view overall standings
- **R4.4** Rankings SHALL update automatically when new results are added

### R5: System Requirements
- **R5.1** The system SHALL support image uploads
- **R5.2** The system SHALL provide a backend service with API
- **R5.3** All data SHALL be stored persistently
- **R5.4** The system SHALL support multiple concurrent users

## Provided Skeleton (Hour 0)
A basic starter implementation will include:
- Basic API structure with endpoints stubs
- Database schema for users, games, and results
- Simple frontend template with routing
- Image upload functionality
- Docker compose setup for easy deployment

## Team Competition Tracks (Hours 1-4)
Teams can choose to excel in one or more of these areas:

### Track A: Advanced Rankings & Analytics
- Implement sophisticated ranking algorithms (ELO, Glicko, TrueSkill)
- Create detailed player statistics and insights
- Build performance prediction models
- Design head-to-head comparison tools

### Track B: Social & Engagement Features
- Build real-time game notifications
- Create player profiles and social connections
- Implement team/clan functionality
- Add commenting and reactions to game results
- Design achievement and badge systems

### Track C: Tournament & League Management
- Create tournament bracket systems
- Implement season/league functionality
- Build scheduling and matchmaking features
- Design automated tournament progression

### Track D: User Experience & Visualization
- Create beautiful, interactive scoreboards
- Build mobile-responsive interfaces
- Implement real-time updates
- Design data visualization dashboards
- Add game-specific themes and customization

### Track E: Game-Specific Integrations
- Build specialized scoring for different game types
- Create game-specific rules and validations
- Implement handicap systems
- Design multi-game championships

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Each team must implement at least:
1. User creation with username
2. Create a game with image upload
3. Submit game results
4. View a basic scoreboard
5. Browse existing games

## Constraints
- No real authentication required initially (username only)
- Focus on functionality over visual design
- Backend API should be RESTful
- Data must persist between sessions

## Example Use Cases
1. **Foosball at the office**: Employees track their daily foosball matches, maintaining a company-wide leaderboard
2. **FIFA tournaments**: Friends track their PlayStation FIFA matches across multiple sessions
3. **Card game nights**: Regular poker or card game groups track their wins and losses over time

## Competition Judging Criteria
Teams will be evaluated on:
1. **Core Functionality** (25%): MVP requirements work correctly
2. **Track Excellence** (35%): Depth and quality of chosen track implementation
3. **Innovation** (20%): Creative solutions and unique features
4. **Code Quality** (10%): Clean, maintainable, and well-structured code
5. **Demo & Presentation** (10%): Clear demonstration of features and value

## Workshop Timeline
- **Hour 0**: Setup, skeleton walkthrough, team formation
- **Hour 1-3**: Development sprint
- **Hour 3.5**: Final commits, prepare demos
- **Hour 4**: Team presentations and judging

## Tips for Success
- Focus on your chosen track after completing MVP
- Use the skeleton effectively - don't reinvent basics
- Collaborate within your team, compete between teams
- Think about what would make YOUR game tracking experience better
- Demo the unique value your team brings
