# Game Results Tracking Platform - Requirements Specification

## Overview
A platform for tracking game results across different types of games (video games, table games, card games) with scoreboards and player rankings.

## Core Requirements

### R1: User Management
- **R1.1** Users SHALL be able to create an account using only a username
- **R1.2** Users SHALL be able to modify their username
- **R1.3** The system SHALL support future integration with proper authentication mechanisms

### R2: Game Management
- **R2.1** Users SHALL be able to create new game entries
- **R2.2** Game creation SHALL include uploading an image to identify the game
- **R2.3** Games SHALL have a name and type (e.g., video game, table game, card game)
- **R2.4** Users SHALL be able to browse and search for existing games

### R3: Result Tracking
- **R3.1** Users SHALL be able to submit game results
- **R3.2** A game result MUST include:
  - The game played
  - Players involved
  - Final scores or outcome
  - Timestamp
- **R3.3** Users SHALL be able to view their game history
- **R3.4** The system SHALL store all game results persistently

### R4: Scoreboards
- **R4.1** The system SHALL display scoreboards for each game
- **R4.2** Scoreboards SHALL show player rankings based on wins/losses
- **R4.3** Users SHALL be able to view overall standings
- **R4.4** Rankings SHALL update automatically when new results are added

### R5: System Requirements
- **R5.1** The system SHALL support image uploads
- **R5.2** The system SHALL provide a backend service with API
- **R5.3** All data SHALL be stored persistently
- **R5.4** The system SHALL support multiple concurrent users

## Open-Ended Extension Points
The following areas are intentionally left open for hackathon participants to explore and implement creatively:

### Ranking Algorithms
- How should players be ranked? (Simple win/loss, point systems, ELO ratings, etc.)
- Should different games use different ranking systems?

### Social Features
- How can players interact with each other?
- What information should be visible on player profiles?
- Should there be team/group functionalities?

### Game Categories & Organization
- How should games be categorized and filtered?
- Should there be support for tournaments or leagues?
- Can games have multiple modes or variations?

### Data Visualization
- How should statistics be displayed?
- What insights can be derived from game history?
- How can performance trends be shown?

### Gamification
- Should there be achievements or badges?
- How can we encourage regular participation?
- What makes the platform engaging?

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
For the hackathon baseline, implement at least:
1. User creation with username
2. Create a game with image upload
3. Submit game results
4. View a basic scoreboard
5. Browse existing games

## Constraints
- No real authentication required initially (username only)
- Focus on functionality over visual design
- Backend API should be RESTful
- Data must persist between sessions

## Example Use Cases
1. **Foosball at the office**: Employees track their daily foosball matches, maintaining a company-wide leaderboard
2. **FIFA tournaments**: Friends track their PlayStation FIFA matches across multiple sessions
3. **Card game nights**: Regular poker or card game groups track their wins and losses over time

## Success Criteria
The solution should allow users to:
- Create and identify games through images
- Track results over time
- View competitive rankings
- Discover what games others are playing
