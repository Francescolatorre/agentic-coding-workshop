## Team Formation Guidelines

### AI Experience Levels
Each team should include members from different experience levels:

1. **Beginner**: Does not use AI tools for development
2. **Casual User**: Occasionally uses ChatGPT for problem-solving
3. **Regular User**: Uses AI coding assistants in IDEs (Copilot, Cursor) or CLI tools (Claude Code)
4. **Advanced User**: Leverages multiple agents, parallel processing, and advanced AI workflows

**Important**: Teams must be balanced across these experience levels for fair competition.

## The Challenge

### Objective
Build a platform for tracking game results with scoreboards and rankings. See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for detailed requirements.

## Handout
If you get stuck or it's unclear how to continue, try the [handout.md](handout.md). 

### Core Requirements (MVP)
- User creation with username
- Game creation with image upload
- Result submission
- Basic scoreboard display
- Game browsing

### Evaluation Criteria

#### Functional (50%)
- Core features work correctly
- User workflows are complete
- Data persists properly

#### Non-Functional (50%)
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable architecture
- **Design**: Thoughtful system design and extensibility
- **Innovation**: Creative solutions and unique features
- **AI Usage**: Effective use of agentic coding techniques

## Presentation Guidelines

Each team will present for 5 minutes covering:
1. **Demo**: Show your working application
2. **Architecture**: AI-generated summary of your solution
3. **AI Techniques**: How you used agentic coding
4. **Unique Features**: What sets your solution apart

## Prizes

Top teams will be awarded based on combined functional and non-functional scores. Prizes will be announced at the event conclusion.

## Resources

- **Requirements**: See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md)
- **AI Tools Setup**: See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for Codex, Claude Code, and RooCode configuration
- **Support**: Workshop facilitators will be available for questions

## Starter Template

A Next.js starter template is available in the `hackathon-starter/` folder.

**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Jest

**Requirements**: Node.js 18+

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd hackathon-starter
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will run at `http://localhost:3000`
